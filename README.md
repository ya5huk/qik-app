## What is qik

qik is a simple & modern fast chat app where making a group takes less than a minute - just copy a link and send to your friends to create a group chat!
The chat is currently designed for fast communication, which means it shows only number of messages. Messages that are not shown on the group chat page are deleted.

# How it's made
